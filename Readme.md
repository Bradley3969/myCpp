# myCpp — C++ Project (CMake + Ninja + clang + Docker)

************
## 🔧 Quick Start — Clean / Build / Run

**To clean at:**  
`~/Desktop/myCpp`
```bash
rm -rf build
************To configure (generate build files) at:
~/Desktop/myCpp

bash
Copy code
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ for my comp

**********To build at:
~/Desktop/myCpp

bash
Copy code
cmake --build build

***********To run at project root:
~/Desktop/myCpp

bash
Copy code
*********use this one dumby
./build/myCpp
To run from build directory:
~/Desktop/myCpp/build

bash

🧠 Core Mental Model
Docker = environment (OS + tools)

CMake = generates build files

Ninja = builds the code

Executable = what you actually run

Docker does not replace CMake.
CMake does not replace Ninja.
Once built, you just run the binary.

🐳 Docker Usage
All build and run commands are executed inside the Docker container.

Typical flow:

Start / enter container

cd into the project directory

Use CMake + Ninja as normal

🔁 When to Update Things
✅ Edit .cpp files
Do not touch CMake or Docker

Just rebuild

✅ Add new .cpp files or folders
Update CMakeLists.txt

Rebuild (sometimes reconfigure)

✅ Add libraries (OpenGL, GLFW, etc.)
Update CMakeLists.txt

Clean + reconfigure

✅ Add system dependencies
Update Dockerfile

Rebuild Docker image

🚫 Do NOT Edit Manually
build/

CMakeCache.txt

CMakeFiles/

build.ninja

These are generated automatically.

📌 Golden Rule
Enter Docker → Run CMake → Build → Run Binary

If the executable exists, nothing else matters.

🧠 Professional Advice / Reminder
Keep source files in src/ and headers in include/ as project grows.

Use out-of-source builds (build/) always.

Only edit CMakeLists.txt when adding files, folders, or libraries.

Docker is only for environment consistency — do not touch it for normal builds.
